Configure DB:

Mysql database is used for storing data.
Configure username and password in application.properties file of your mysql connector.
Create a schema named "nomitri" in the database.
Run the application and execute the insert queries present in src/main/resources/data.sql file.


Improvements that could be added for the future:
Soft delete would be a better option so that previous order history could be shown to the customer.
Spring security could be implemented to authorise the API access.
